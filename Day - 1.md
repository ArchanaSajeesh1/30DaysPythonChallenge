### Three ways to print output:

age = 21

print(age)

print("I am " + str(age) + " years old") -- using + symbol for which need to convert number to string which is called type convertion to concatenate all 3 text 
into single string

print("I am",age,"years old") --using ,

print(f"I am {age} years old")--using f-string

### Result:

I am 21 years old



### Integer

### Input 

age = 21

player=2

quantity=5

print(f"you are {age} years old");

print(f"There are {player} online");

print(f"you would like to buy {quantity} items")

### output:

you are 21 years old

There are 2 online

you would like to buy 5 items



### float

### Input:

gpa = 3.2

distance = 2.5

price=10.99

print(f"your gpa is {gpa}")

print(f"you ran {distance} km")

print(f"The price is ${price}")

### output:

your gpa is 3.2

you ran 2.5 km

The price is $10.99



### String

### Input:

name = "Archana"

food="Dosa"

email = "arc@123.com"

print(f"My name is {name}")

print(f"I love {food}")

print(f"my email id is {email}")

### output:

My name is Archana

I love Dosa

my email id is arc@123.com



### Boolean

### Input:

online = True

for_sales = False

running =True

print(f"Are you Online? : {online}")

print(f"Is the item for sale? :{for_sales}")

print(f"Are you running?: {running}")

### output:

Are you Online? : True

Is the item for sale? :False
